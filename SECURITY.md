## Security Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying CodeWeaver, follow these security best practices:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use secure, randomly generated values for `SESSION_SECRET`
   - Store sensitive API keys securely and rotate them periodically
   - Never commit `.env` files to your repository

2. **Authentication**:
   - Use the built-in GitHub OAuth for authentication
   - Configure proper callback URLs as described in the documentation

3. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting on your server to prevent abuse
   - Monitor unusual API usage patterns

4. **Data Security**:
   - Regularly back up your MongoDB database
   - Restrict MongoDB access to trusted networks
   - Enable MongoDB authentication

5. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies updated using `npm audit` and `npm update`
   - Subscribe to this repository for security announcements

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

Our general policy follows these timelines:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Validation**: Within 7 days
- **Solution Development**: Depends on complexity, typically 30-90 days
- **Release of Fix**: As soon as possible after development
- **Public Disclosure**: After a fix has been released and users have had time to update
